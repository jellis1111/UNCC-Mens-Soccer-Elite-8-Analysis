# Charlotte Men's Soccer: 2023 Elite Eight Comparative Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository documents a key scouting and performance analysis project conducted for the **University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC) Men's Soccer program**.

The primary objective was to quantitatively benchmark UNCC's player performance across key positions against the statistical profiles of teams that reached the **2023 NCAA Elite Eight tournament**. The final report was designed to identify areas of strength and gaps for targeted player development and recruitment in the subsequent offseason.

## Core Data: The Comparative Profile

The most critical file in this repository is the main analysis sheet: **`Offseason Project_metrics.xlsx - Profiles.csv`**.

This sheet provides the direct comparison by calculating the **difference** between the Elite Eight average metric and the corresponding UNCC player metric, broken down by position:

* **Striker**
* **Winger**
* **Center Backs**
* **Fullbacks**
* **Goalkeeper**

### Key Comparison Metrics Include:

* **Goals to xG (Expected Goals):** Measuring finishing efficiency.
* **Defensive Duels Won %:** Evaluating defensive solidity and pressure effectiveness.
* **Accurate Passes % / Progressive Passes %:** Assessing ball retention and buildup quality.
* **Opponent Half Recoveries:** Highlighting ability to regain possession high up the pitch.
